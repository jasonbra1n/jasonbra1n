Following up on this morning's post about strategic content pivots, I'm thrilled to announce the official release of **v1.5.0**, a milestone update that solidifies the project's architecture and professional branding.

This release is themed around the "Creative Technologist" persona, focusing on standardizing the application's backend and formalizing the Human-AI collaborative workflow that has been so instrumental in this project's rapid development.

## 🏗️ Architectural Standardization: The Bootstrap Entrypoint

The most significant change in this release is the implementation of `src/bootstrap.php`. Previously, each page was responsible for loading its own configuration. Now, every page on the site starts with a single, unified entry point:

```php
<?php
// Load application bootstrap
if (file_exists('src/bootstrap.php')) {
    require_once 'src/bootstrap.php';
}
```

This architectural shift replaces scattered configuration checks with a clean, centralized initialization process. It paves the way for future enhancements like class autoloading and dependency management, making the entire application more robust and scalable.

## 🤖 AI & Development Workflow

This project is not just a portfolio; it's a living demonstration of a modern development process. Version 1.5.0 formalizes this:

-   **DJ Brain Project**: I've officially added the **DJ Brain** project to my portfolio. This self-hosted AI jukebox system is a perfect showcase of my full-stack skills, combining Docker, Python, and PHP.
-   **AI Collaboration**: The `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `README.md` files now explicitly document the use of **Gemini** and Google's **"Antigravity" IDE** as core components of my development stack.
-   **Starter Prompts**: To streamline future AI coding sessions, I've created a `prompt.md` file in the repository root. This contains pre-built prompts to quickly bring Gemini up to speed on the project's context and standards.

### What's Next?

With the architecture now standardized around `bootstrap.php`, the next phase will focus on the **"Image Optimization"** task from the roadmap, where we'll implement responsive images using `srcset` to further improve performance.
