# Blogger Templates

This directory contains the XML templates for the jasonbrain.com blogs, which are hosted on the Blogger platform.

- **Music Blog**: [blog.jasonbrain.com](https://blog.jasonbrain.com/)
- **Tech Blog**: [devblog.jasonbrain.com](https://devblog.jasonbrain.com/)

## Purpose

The templates are stored here to be version-controlled and kept in sync with the main website's branding as defined in the root `STYLE_GUIDE.md`.

## Files
- `blogger-template.xml`: The primary, active template used for the blogs. It is designed to be a single source of truth for both the music and tech blogs.

When updating the main site's CSS or layout, this template should be reviewed to see if corresponding changes are needed to maintain a consistent user experience across all properties.
