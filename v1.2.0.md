# Release v1.2.0: Server-Side Architecture & Blog Foundation

This release marks a significant evolution of the site's backend architecture, moving from a static, JavaScript-driven component model to a more robust and maintainable PHP-based structure. This version also establishes the foundational work for brand-aligned blog templates.

## Key Changes

### 🚀 Architectural Overhaul (PHP Implementation)
- **Server-Side Includes**: All pages have been converted from `.html` to `.php` to leverage server-side includes. The previous JavaScript-based method for loading the navigation and footer has been replaced with `<?php include '...'; ?>`, improving performance and reliability.
- **Self-Hosted Contact Form**: The dependency on the third-party Formspree service has been removed. A new self-hosted PHP script now securely handles all contact form submissions.

### 📝 Blog Template Development
- **Custom Blogger Template**: A new custom Blogger XML template (`blogger-template.xml`) has been created and refined.
- **Style Guide Alignment**: The template has been refactored to use the project's official CSS variables, ensuring the blogs' visual identity perfectly matches the main website.

### ✨ Site & Content Enhancements
- **New Pages**: Dedicated `/about/` and `/contact/` pages have been created, improving site structure and user navigation.
- **Standardized Footer**: A reusable `footer.html` component has been implemented across the entire site for consistency.

## Looking Forward

With the backend architecture now solidified on PHP and the blog template ready for deployment, the project is well-positioned to focus on the next set of goals from the roadmap, including the "Performance & Accessibility Pass" and content population for the blogs.
