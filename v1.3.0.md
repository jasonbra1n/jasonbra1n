# Release v1.3.0: Performance, Accessibility & Portfolio Updates

This release focuses on improving the site's performance and accessibility, along with updates to the Web Developer portfolio section.

## Key Changes

### ⚡ Performance & Accessibility
- **Iframe Optimization**: Implemented the "click-to-load" facade pattern on the Music Production page. This significantly reduces initial page load time by deferring the loading of heavy third-party media players (SoundCloud, HearThis.at) until user interaction.
- **Accessibility Improvements**: Removed inline `onclick` attributes from interactive cards (`.package-card`, `.venue-card`) and implemented proper keyboard navigation support via `script.js`.

### 🛠️ Site Enhancements
- **Custom 404 Page**: Added a dedicated `404.php` error page to handle missing resources gracefully and guide users back to the homepage.
- **Portfolio Update**: Updated the **Project Showcase** in the Web Developer section to feature the `jasonbrain.com` monorepo and the new `lab.jasonbrain.com` SPA project.

## Looking Forward

With these performance and accessibility foundations in place, the next steps will focus on expanding the "click-to-load" pattern to other pages (like Wedding DJ) and continuing with image optimizations.
