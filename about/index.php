            <strong>I don't just create – I architect experiences that bridge music, technology, and human connection.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            My journey began spinning records at public school dance events across Ontario, evolved through legendary nights closing Lindsay's York Tavern, and has transformed into a multi-faceted creative practice. Today, I merge three decades of musical intuition with cutting-edge technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            From producing healing frequency trance as ΙΑΣΩΝ to developing AI-powered web solutions, I bring the same passion for connection and innovation to every project. <em>Every service I offer is built on the foundation of understanding what moves people.</em>
