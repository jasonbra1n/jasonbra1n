# Release v1.4.3: Centralized Header & Configuration

This release focuses on architectural cleanup by centralizing the `<head>` section of all pages into a single server-side include. This ensures consistent SEO metadata, analytics tags, and CSS links across the entire site.

## Key Changes

### 🏗️ Architectural Refactoring
- **Shared Head Include**: Created `head.php` to manage all `<head>` elements (meta tags, title, CSS, JS) in one place.
- **Page Updates**: Refactored `index.php`, `/about/`, and `/contact/` to use this new include, significantly reducing code duplication.

### ⚙️ Configuration
- **SEO Constants**: Added new constants to `config.php` (and `config-sample.php`) for `SITE_AUTHOR`, `SITE_DESCRIPTION`, and `SITE_KEYWORDS` to allow for global SEO management.

### 📚 Documentation
- **README Updates**: Refined the project links in the main `README.md` to point to the newly created case study pages.

## Looking Forward

With the header now centralized, future updates to analytics scripts or global styles can be deployed instantly across all pages by modifying a single file.
