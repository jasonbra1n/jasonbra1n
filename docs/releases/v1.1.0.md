# Release v1.1.0: Architectural Refactoring & Code Unification

This is a major foundational release focused on a complete architectural refactoring of the jasonbrain.com website. The primary goal was to move away from a distributed multi-subdomain structure to a unified, single-repository architecture. This change dramatically improves maintainability, streamlines the development workflow, and sets a solid foundation for future features.

## Key Changes

### 🏗️ Unified Site Architecture
- **Subdomain to Subfolder Migration**: All primary service pages (Wedding DJ, Music Production, Web Developer, Corporate Events) have been migrated from individual subdomains into a cohesive subfolder structure (e.g., `/wedding-dj/`) within the main repository. This simplifies deployment, content management, and SEO.

### 🧹 Codebase Health & Consolidation
- **Shared Assets**: All pages now use a single, centralized `styles.css` and `script.js` file from the root directory. This eliminates massive code duplication and ensures visual and functional consistency across the entire site.
- **Shared Navigation**: A dynamic navigation menu has been implemented, loaded via JavaScript from a single `nav.html` source file. Changes to the menu now only need to be made in one place.
- **CSS Refactoring**: The main stylesheet has been refactored to use CSS Variables as defined in the `STYLE_GUIDE.md`, making theming and future style adjustments significantly easier and more reliable.
- **Asset Cleanup**: All redundant `styles.css`, `script.js`, and `sitemap.xml` files have been removed from the service subdirectories, resulting in a much cleaner and more organized project structure.

### 📄 New Documentation & Tooling
- **Project Documentation**: Comprehensive project documentation has been added, including `ROADMAP.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `STYLE_GUIDE.md`, to guide future development.
- **Consolidated Sitemap**: A new, consolidated `sitemap.xml` has been created in the root directory for improved SEO.
- **Blogger Templates**: A `blogger-templates` directory was established with a `base-template.xml` to guide the development of brand-consistent themes for the external blogs.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fixed a race condition that prevented the dynamic navigation menu from loading correctly on the homepage.
- Restored the interactive water ripple effect in the header, which was inadvertently removed during the JavaScript refactoring.
