# Release v1.4.0: Professional Resume & Creative Technologist Branding

This release focuses on rebranding the digital portfolio to highlight the fusion of creative experience with deep technical expertise. It introduces a professional resume section and realigns the site's narrative to position Jason Brain as a "Creative Technologist" — bridging the gap between art, music, and engineering.

## Key Changes

### 📄 Professional Resume
- **New Section**: A dedicated `/resume/` page has been added. It features a clean, print-friendly layout that details education (Fleming College), certifications (MCP), and a hybrid work history of technical and entrepreneurial roles.
- **Print Optimization**: The page includes specific CSS media queries to ensure it prints (or saves to PDF) cleanly, hiding navigation and footer elements.

### 🔄 Narrative Shift
- **About Page**: The `/about/` section was rewritten to tell the story of "Where Creativity Meets Technical Precision," connecting formal technical education with the practical application of technology in creative fields.
- **GitHub Profile**: The `README.md` was updated to serve as a technical landing page for recruiters and developers.

### 🛠️ Functional Updates
- **Navigation**: The main menu now includes a direct link to the Resume.
- **Contact Form**: Potential employers can now select "Employment / Hiring Inquiry" directly from the contact form dropdown.

## Looking Forward

With the professional branding now in place, the next steps will involve building out the "Lab" or "Projects" section to showcase specific hardware and code examples (3D printing, IoT) mentioned in the new resume.
