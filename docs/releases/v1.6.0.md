## Key Changes

### 🚀 Developer Experience & Repository Hub
- **GitHub Pages Hub**: Launched a new static `index.html` at the repository root to serve as a project hub on GitHub Pages. This provides a clear entry point for developers and visitors to the repository.
- **Repository Hub Refinement**: Updated the root `index.html` to serve as a broader "Creative Technologist Hub", linking to the BrainAV organization and GitHub profile.
- **AI Workflow**: Enhanced the AI collaboration workflow by adding new, context-aware prompts in `.gemini/prompt.md` specifically for development within the `public/` directory.

### 📚 Content & User Experience
- **Blog Landing Page**: Created a new `/blog/` landing page to act as a central hub for the Music and Tech blogs, improving content discovery.
- **Contact Page Enhancements**: Added a sidebar with social media links to the contact page, providing more ways for users to connect.

### 🛠️ Fixes & Refinements
- **Accessibility**: Converted `div`-based venue cards to semantic `<a>` tags, improving keyboard navigation and screen reader support.
- **UI Consistency**: Fixed a missing site header on the contact page and added standardized styles for social media link grids.
- **README**: Added a "Project Hub" badge to `README.md` linking to the new GitHub Pages landing page.

With these foundational and content-centric updates complete, the next sprint will prioritize the **"Performance & Accessibility Pass"** from the roadmap. Key tasks include implementing responsive images with `srcset` and minifying CSS/JS assets to improve site-wide load times.
