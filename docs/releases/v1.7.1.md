## Key Changes

### 🛠️ Admin Dashboard & CMS
- **Secure Authentication**: Implemented a robust login system with session management, password hashing, and a secure "Remember Me" feature using persistent tokens.
- **Dashboard Hub**: Launched a protected admin area (`/admin/`) to serve as the control center for the site.
- **Settings Management**: Created a database-backed settings interface (`admin/settings.php`) allowing administrators to manage API keys and site configurations without editing code.
- **System Diagnostics**: Added a comprehensive diagnostics tool (`admin/db-check.php`) to monitor database connectivity and table status.

### 🚧 Maintenance Mode
- **Database-Driven Control**: Implemented a global maintenance mode that can be toggled instantly from the admin settings.
- **Smart Access**: When enabled, public visitors see a friendly "Under Maintenance" page, while logged-in administrators can still access and preview the live site.

### 🤖 AI Integration
- **Gemini Service**: Introduced `src/GeminiService.php`, a dedicated class for handling communication with the Google Gemini API. This lays the groundwork for future AI-powered features like content generation and the "AI Site Builder."

### 💾 Database Infrastructure
- **Schema Definition**: Established `database/database.sql` as the source of truth for the application's data structure (`users`, `settings`, `auth_tokens`).
- **Documentation**: Published a comprehensive Database Management Guide to assist developers with schema updates and migrations.

### 🎨 UI & Content Refinements
- **Festive Mode**: Added a seasonal "Snowflake" animation to the header, automatically activating during the holiday season.
- **Contact Page**: Redesigned the layout to move the contact form "above the fold" for better user engagement.
- **About Page**: Implemented a modern glassmorphism header design.
- **Resume**: Updated professional history with detailed achievements in systems operations and ITIL transformation.

## Looking Forward

With the CMS foundation and AI service layer in place, the next phase of development will focus on **Content Management Tools**, specifically building the "SEO Optimizer" to auto-generate meta descriptions and the "AI Site Builder" prototype.
