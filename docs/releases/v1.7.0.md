## Key Changes

- **Mobile UI**: Improved alignment and hover states for mobile menu items.

### 🌐 Social Connectivity
- **Expanded Network**: Added GitHub, YouTube, and HearThis.at links to the Contact page and `config.php`.
- **Project Hub**: Updated the repository root `index.html` with absolute links to documentation and the new social icons.

### 🛠️ Workflow & Documentation
- **AI Workflow**: Streamlined `.gemini/PROMPT_GUIDE.md` for a faster "Quick Sync" process.

## Looking Forward

The next sprint will continue the **"Performance & Accessibility Pass"**, focusing on:
1.  Applying responsive images to all service pages.
2.  Adding explicit width/height attributes to prevent CLS.
3.  Deferring third-party scripts (Google Ads/Analytics).
