# Release v1.4.1: Security Hardening & Form Standardization

This release focuses on standardizing all contact forms across the site to use a secure, self-hosted PHP method, eliminating third-party dependencies. It also includes style refinements for buttons and testimonials.

## Key Changes

### 🔒 Form Security & Standardization
- **Self-Hosted PHP**: Converted all remaining service page contact forms (Wedding DJ, Corporate Events, Music Production, Web Developer) from Formspree to a custom self-hosted PHP solution.
- **Credential Management**: Implemented strict usage of `config.php` for email credentials, ensuring sensitive data is never hardcoded.
- **Documentation**: Updated `CONTRIBUTING.md` to explicitly define security standards for form handling.

### 🎨 UI/UX Refinements
- **Button Styling**: Removed text decoration (underlines) from all `.cta-button` elements to ensure a cleaner, more modern look consistent with the brand.
- **Testimonials**: Added global CSS classes for the Testimonials section to allow for consistent reuse across different pages.
- **Interactivity**: Added a toggle function for the testimonial submission form to improve user experience.

## Looking Forward

With the security and form infrastructure now standardized, the next phase will focus on enhancing the user feedback loop by implementing a "Star Rating" system for testimonials. Additionally, we will prioritize **Iframe Optimization** by expanding the "click-to-load" facade pattern to the Wedding DJ and Corporate Events pages to significantly improve page load speeds.
