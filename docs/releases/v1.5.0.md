# Release v1.5.0: The "Creative Technologist" Update

This milestone release solidifies the project's architecture and professional branding. It introduces a standardized bootstrapping process for the PHP application, formalizes the Human-AI collaborative workflow, and expands the portfolio to include the "DJ Brain" AI project.

## Key Highlights

### 🏗️ Architectural Standardization
- **Bootstrap Entrypoint**: Implemented `src/bootstrap.php` as the single entry point for all pages. This replaces scattered configuration checks with a unified initialization process, paving the way for future autoloading and dependency management.
- **Centralized Headers**: Completed the migration of all pages (including case studies and resume) to use the shared `head.php` include.

### 🤖 AI & Development Workflow
- **DJ Brain Project**: Officially added the "DJ Brain" self-hosted AI jukebox system to the portfolio, showcasing full-stack Docker/Python/PHP skills.
- **AI Collaboration**: Formalized the use of Gemini and Google's "Antigravity" IDE in `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `README.md`, highlighting a modern, AI-assisted development stack.
- **Starter Prompts**: Added `prompt.md` to the repository root to streamline future AI coding sessions.

### 🎨 Content & UI
- **Resume Page**: Launched a dedicated, print-friendly `/resume/` page.
- **Service Page Refinement**: Refactored headers and content on Wedding DJ, Music Production, and Corporate Events pages for better visual hierarchy and SEO.

## Looking Forward

With the architecture now standardized around `bootstrap.php`, the next phase will focus on **Image Optimization** (responsive images) and further performance tuning.
