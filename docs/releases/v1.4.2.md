## Key Changes

### 📚 Content & Strategy
- **Corporate Events Pivot**: Completely rewrote the Corporate Events section to target "Northern Retreats" and Haliburton-based off-site events, moving away from the general Toronto market.
- **Project Case Studies**: Launched detailed case study pages for `jasonbrain.com` and `lab.jasonbrain.com` to showcase technical architecture and decision-making.
- **Resume Update**: Added 6+ years of broadcast production experience (Rogers TV) to the resume.

### ⚡ Performance & UI
- **Iframe Facade Pattern**: Extended the "click-to-load" optimization to the Wedding DJ page, preventing heavy media players (Spotify, HearThis.at) from blocking initial page load.
- **FAQ Accordions**: Refactored FAQ sections on all service pages into interactive, collapsible accordions for better readability.
- **Spotify Placeholders**: Added custom-styled placeholders for Spotify embeds to maintain visual consistency before loading.

## Looking Forward

The next sprint will focus on **Image Optimization** to further improve Core Web Vitals, specifically implementing `srcset` for responsive image delivery across devices.
